Digit Recognition Model
This repository contains a digit recognition model trained using the MNIST dataset. The model can accurately identify handwritten digits (0-9) by employing a range of feature extraction techniques and machine learning algorithms. This project was developed with a focus on maximizing accuracy and efficiency, using various preprocessing and feature extraction methods.

Features
Feature Extraction Techniques:

Pixel Intensity: The grayscale intensity of each pixel, helping to define the shape of the digit.
Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG): Captures the gradients and orientations in the image, enhancing shape recognition.
Sobel Operators: Detects edges by highlighting regions of high intensity change, providing edge details.
Harris Corner Detection: Identifies corner points, adding detail to the shape of the digit.
Texture Features: Analyses the texture to enhance digit recognition accuracy.
Zernike Moments: Captures shape and rotation characteristics, adding robustness against small changes.
Libraries Used:

TensorFlow and Keras: For creating and training deep learning models.
OpenCV (cv2): To perform image processing tasks like edge and corner detection.
NumPy and Pandas: For data handling and manipulation.
Matplotlib: To visualize data and model performance.
Scikit-learn (sklearn): For implementing machine learning algorithms and evaluating performance.

Getting Started
